    "## ðŸ”§ Preprocessing\n",
    " - Identify and impute missing values for continuous and categorical features.\n",
    " - Encode gender and other categorical fields using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.\n",
    " - Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler.\n",
    " - Remove outliers in exam_stress_level and part_time_work_hours using Z-score.\n",
    " - Drop duplicate records if present.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    " - Plot histograms of gpa, mental_health_score, and exam_stress_level.\n",
    " - Analyze the relationship between hours_studied and gpa using a regression plot.\n",
    " - Compare average GPA between students with high and low sleep_quality.\n",
    " - Plot a correlation heatmap for all numeric variables.\n",
    " - Visualize gender distribution with a pie chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“ˆ Regression Models\n",
    " - Build a Linear Regression model to predict gpa using all other numeric features.\n",
    " - Evaluate the model using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.\n",
    " - Visualize predicted vs actual GPA with a scatter plot.\n",
    " - Compare prediction results for mental_health_score using a regression model â€” which features are more predictive?\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Classification Models\n",
    " - Train a Logistic Regression model to classify passed_gpa.\n",
    " - Evaluate using precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score.\n",
    " - Train a Decision Tree Classifier to predict healthy_lifestyle.\n",
    " - Visualize the tree and discuss feature importance.\n",
    " - Use a Random Forest Classifier and compare its F1 score with the Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§© Clustering\n",
    " - Cluster students into 3 groups using KMeans on sleep_quality, exam_stress_level, and mental_health_score.\n",
    " - Reduce dimensionality with t-SNE and visualize clusters with color-coded points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## âš™ Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    " - Use SVM to classify whether a student passed_gpa using all features.\n",
    " - Try both linear and RBF kernels and compare their performance metrics."

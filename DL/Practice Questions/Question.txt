A. Data Preparation
Load the dataset using Pandas.
 
Print the first 5 rows.
 
Check for null values.
 
Plot histograms of each feature to understand distributions.
 
Normalize features using MinMaxScaler.
 
B. Train/Test Split
Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).
 
Separate input features (X) and target (y).
 
C. Model Design (Sequential + Dense)
Build a Sequential model with 2 hidden layers.
 
Explain the choice of ReLU as activation.
 
Add the final output layer for regression.
 
D. Model Compilation
Compile the model with optimizer and loss.
 
E. Model Training
Train model for 50 epochs, batch size = 32.
 
Include a validation split of 10%.
 
Visualize training and validation loss.
 
F. Model Evaluation
Evaluate on test set.
 
Predict on test set and compare with true values.
 
Calculate RMSE manually.
 
G. Model Improvement
Add dropout and observe changes in performance.
 
Try increasing epochs to 100 and compare loss curve.
 
Use EarlyStopping callback to prevent overfitting.
